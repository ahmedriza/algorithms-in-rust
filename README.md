# Algorithms in Rust

This repository is based on the book, Algorithms in C++, 3rd edition, Robert Sedgewick, Addison-Wesley 1998.

Professor Sedgewick has published a number of books on algorithms and the different editions of the Algorithms
book use different programming languages.  However, the fundamental ideas transcend the language of 
implementation and most of us working programmers can pick up any of them and start learning straright away,
regardless of whether the algorithms are implemented in C, C++, Java or something else. Programming 
languages go in and out of fashion, but algorithms and their beauty are long lasting.

I have been greatly inspired by the teachings of Professor Sedgewick, in particular his MOOCs on algorithms.
As I continue to learn and refresh my knowledge on the material I have learnt, I found it useful to go over
the algorithms again, but using Rust instead as the implementation language.

Rust offers a fresh perspective on algorithm implementations that are unique.
